# mchicha.exe 🥀
> **disclamer:** this game is unfair and cancerous. if you break your keyboard, that's on you lol.

### what have we done

**mchicha.exe** is a "platformer" (in the loosest sense of the word) inspired by analog horror, creepy pasta games, and that specific type of rage you only feel when a jump doesn't register.

we made this for the **1337 Game Jam** (don't ask how the jam went). the theme was probably something reasonable (10 seconds to impact they said), but we decided to make whatever this is instead.

### "features"

* **Analog Horror Vibes:** VHS shaders, unsettling noises, and things that watch you.
* **Unfair Gameplay:** think *Cat Mario* or *Devil Level* but worse. fake platforms? yes. traps that make zero sense? absolutely.
* **The .exe Experience:** is it a game? is it a virus? (it's a game wlh, please don't report us lmao).
* **Spaghetti Code:** handcrafted with love and panic.

### the team (blame these people)

if you hated the level design, direct your complaints to:

* **Mohammed Nassiri**
* **Yassine Esserdaoui**
* **Hamza Sahraoui**

### how to play

1. visit the game page on itch.
2. download `mchicha.exe`.
3. turn off the lights.
4. regret your decisions.

### tech stack

* **Engine:** Godot (because fuck C#)
* **Art:** Hamza (and Gemini)
* **Audio:** we seriously don't remember
